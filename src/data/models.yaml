      - name: scGPT
        description: scGPT is a generative pre-trained transformer model specifically designed for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. It leverages the power of transformer architectures to capture the intricate relationships between genes and cells, enabling accurate cell type identification, differential expression analysis, and trajectory inference.
